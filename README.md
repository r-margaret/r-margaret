Develop Projects with great User Experience.


Hi, I am Rosario Margaret Daet. You can call me "Margaret".

👀 I’m interested in designing and developing a website and in working with the SDLC/Agile Methodology team
I’m currently learning Firebase and Laravel 8. Now, working with my capstone project — Android Application (end-user) and Website (admin panel).

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the team who will train and help me to enhance my skills and to learn new language and skills.
